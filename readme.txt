About:
    In fish farming, maintenance of water quality is very crucial. Especially in controlled systems like Biofloc and Aquaponics it is required to collect and manage data for taking necessary action in time. Unfortunately, there doesn’t exist any convenient and well designed technological solution for this matter. As a result farmers remain unnotified at the exact time when a huge number of fish die due to sudden increase or decrease of a water component. In short the farmers -
    · faces difficulties to get the right data at the right time
    · lacks the knowledge to make a decision based on gathered data
    · lacks the knowledge about modern fish farming
    · can not communicate with fish doctor
    We aim to solve the above stated problems.
